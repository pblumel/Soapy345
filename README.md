# Soapy345
A (WIP) 345 MHz sensor receiver based on the SoapySDR wrapper for the HackRF One. It is a rewrite of software I wrote previously in Python using GNU Radio.
Currently, baseline hardware functionality and signal processing functionality is working, but needs some adjustment. I am currently working on the decoder for messages sent by the 345 MHz sensors.
